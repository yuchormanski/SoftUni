I’ve actually had the same Rubik’s Cube since I was six, and it’s spent its entire life outside of the packaging unsolved. Every once in a while I’ll pick it up and have a go at it, and every time I disappoint myself. A couple of months ago I tried following a guide to solve it, but even that was over my head. Threatening it with a hammer didn’t work either.",
