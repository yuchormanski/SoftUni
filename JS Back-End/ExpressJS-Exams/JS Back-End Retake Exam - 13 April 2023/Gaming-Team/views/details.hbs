                <p id="description">Disney Dreamlight Valley is a hybrid between a life-sim and an adventure game
                    rich with quests, exploration, and engaging activities featuring Disney and Pixar friends, both
                    old and new. Once an idyllic land, Dreamlight Valley was a place where Disney and Pixar
                    characters lived in harmonyâ€”until the Forgetting. Night Thorns grew across the land and severed
                    the wonderful memories tied to this magical place. With nowhere else to go, the hopeless
                    inhabitants of Dreamlight Valley retreated behind locked doors in the Dream Castle.</p>
