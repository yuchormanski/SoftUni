/* 	Last K Numbers Sequence
You are given two integers n and k.Write a JS function that generates and prints the following sequence:
•	The first element is 1
•	Every following element equals the sum of the previous k elements
•	The length of the sequence is n elements
The input comes as numbers.The first element represents the number n,
    and the second – the number k.
The output is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.
    Examples
Input	            Output
6,3	        1 1 2 4 7 13
8,2	        1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

Explanation
The 2nd element(1) is the sum of the 3 elements before it, but there is only 1, so we take that. 
The third element, is the sum of the first 2(1 and 1) and the 4th – the sum of 1, 1 and 2. 
The 5th element is the sum of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th(1, 2 and 4) and so on.
