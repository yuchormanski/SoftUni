/* 
 02 - Numbers
You are given numbers in a sequence on a single line, separated by a space. 
After that, you will receive commands that modify the sequence differently:
"Add {value}" - you should add the given value to the end of the sequence.
"Remove {value}"- you should remove the first occurrence of the given value if there is such.
"Replace (value} (replacement}" - you should replace the first occurrence of the given 
value with the replacement if there is such occurrence.
"Collapse {value}" you must remove each number with a value less than the given one.
When you receive the command "Finish", you should print the modified sequence and end the program.
Input / Constraints
On the first line, you will receive a sequence with numbers, separated by spaces - integers in the range [-1000...1000].
On the following lines, you will receive commands until the "Finish" command is received.
The commands will always be valid.
Output
Print a single line the array of numbers separated by a space, with the modified values.

â€¢	The possible commands are:
o	"Add {value}"
o	"Remove {value}"
o	"Replace {value} {replacement}"
o	"Collapse {value}"
o	"Finish"
